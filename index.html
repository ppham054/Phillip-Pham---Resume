        <h1 class="mb-3">Phillip Pham
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Finaceüìà</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Phillip was borned in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam and grew up in the Long An province. 
        It was when he turned 6 that he immigrated to California and has lived there since. Attending school in 
        the United States, he would go on to have perfect attendance and to earn many honor roll awards for his
        excellent performance at school. <br><br>

        During his freshman year in high school, he joined his school‚Äôs tutoring program and became a tutor. 
        The following year he was promoted to a head tutor in the tutoring program. He would spend up to 6 
        hours a week tutoring students in help. Here he holds responsibility of not only tutoring other 
        students, but also mentor other tutors so they can be head tutors as well. He would typically 
        spend time during lunch hours helping set up head member meetings. Phillip stayed in the tutoring 
        program until 2019, where he graduated high school.<br><br>

        In Sophomore year he joined the robotics club and helped the team build the club‚Äôs first ever robot.
        Phillip contributed to the club‚Äôs division in charge of planning and constructing the robot. He and 
        the group stayed hours after school learning about the mechanical and electrical ins and outs of the
        robot. It wasn‚Äôt until junior year when the team finally competed in their first ever FIRST competition
        and won 8th place. This victory was a team effort between Phillip and everyone in the club. Of course this
        was done with countless days of development together.<br><br>
        
        During his junior year, Phillip would also join Key Club and participated in many of the events the club has 
        to offer. While the events were just just simple volunteering, he had fun partaking in these activities with
        his friends and even made new friends during his time as a member. 35 West was the division he was in and was
        proud to be a seal. During his stay, he has picked up trash for his community, packed food for the homeless, 
        walked in the AIDs walk, and many more. One of the events he loved the most was the Pumpkin Run, where he ran
        and jogged with a participant. While out of breath, he would try to keep up with the runner and listened to his
        story of tragedy and why the run ment for him. Another memorable event for Phillip was the Spring Rally, where 
        divisions across California, Nevada, and even Hawaii would meet up at Six Flags and compete for the ‚ÄúSpirit Stick.‚Äù 
        To even have permission to attend the event, a threshold of volunteer hours needed to be met. Unfortunately, Division
        35 West never won during Phillip‚Äôs stay at Key Club.<br><br>
